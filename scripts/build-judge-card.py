"""Judge-card builder (B2). Runs at gate-approval time as a pure script.

Re-checks tier-1 machine facts, compares them with the gate report's recorded
`claims:`, compares recorded 1st/2nd review verdicts, and emits a judge card
with a tri-state verdict. Exit 0=🟢 / 1=🔴 (block) / 2=🟡 (needs ack).
Never dispatches an LLM (the second opinion is recorded by the LLM beforehand).
