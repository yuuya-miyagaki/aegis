# Test-runner classification patterns (E1 activity verification).
# Consumed by post-bash.sh (grep -E) and build-judge-card.py (python re).
# CONSTRAINT: stay within the regex subset that behaves identically in BSD/GNU
# `grep -E` AND Python `re` — no [[:space:]], no \b. Use ( |^|$) style
# boundaries instead. tests/test_patterns_parity.py enforces parity with
# shared fixtures; add a fixture line whenever you add a pattern.
#
# Command-position anchor (v1.5.1, nested-subshell extension v1.5.2): a runner
# name matches only at the start of a (sub)command — string start, after ; & |,
# through any run of subshell '(' at that position, across env assignments
# (FOO=bar ), or through known wrappers (npx/bunx, uv/poetry/pipenv run).
# Mentions as arguments (grep vitest package.json) do not match. Quoted spans
# are masked to Q before this anchor applies (T1 above), so quoted regex groups
# (grep -E "(pytest|...)") never reach it; the anchor stays as defense-in-depth
# for unmaskable malformed input (e.g. an unclosed quote). Consumers also
# normalize newlines to ';' BEFORE matching (grep '^' is per-line, python re
# '^' is string-start — normalization keeps the two engines in parity).
# Quote-span mask (T1 v1.5.2): consumers replace "…"/'…' spans with the inert
# token Q BEFORE matching, so quoted runner mentions — grep -E "(unittest|pytest)" f,
# grep "foo; pytest" f — never reach the classifier (quote-blind false-RED root
# fix). Substitution, NOT deletion: deletion would promote trailing arguments to
# command position ('"echo" pytest' -> ' pytest' = green forgery, grill A red-1).
# Apply DQ then SQ — the order is a convention pinned by the parity fixtures.
# Both patterns stay in the grep-E/python-re common subset and contain no '/'
# (safe as sed s/// payloads). Masking is CLASSIFICATION-ONLY: deny-side hooks
# (check-destructive / check-control-plane / check-secrets) must never mask —
# there it would be a quote-wrapping bypass (fail-open). The evidence log keeps
# the raw command (fidelity / payload_sha unchanged).
